            Exotic dance moves<br>
            <br>
            Yes, you are rigth! As part of my post-doctorade work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question<br>
            my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:<br>
            <br>
            Polynesian chicken dance<br>
            A tittle knowsn but very influential dance dating bask as far as 300BC, a Whole village would dance around<br>
            in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful".<br>
            Icelandle brownian shuffle<br>
            Before the Icelanders dveloped fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, witch<br>
            involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shufling their bodles around ip imperceptably<br>
            tiny very rapid movements.One of my fellow students used to say that the thougt this dance inspired<br>
            modem styles such as Twerking.<br>
            Artic robot dance<br>
            An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believedto have<br>
            discovered a new dance stylecharacteristised by "roboide", stiled movements, being practiced by innhabitans<br>
            of Northem Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered it was discovered that they wew just moving like this<br>
            beacause they were really cold.<br>
            <br>
            For more of my research,see my <a href="dance">exotic dance research page</a>.<br>
            Yours Sincerely.<br>
            <br>
